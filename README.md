# Selenium Lab/Homework 13th June

## How to run the program
- Clone the repository to your machine
- Extract the contents of the zip file
- Navigate into the selenium_starter_code directory
- Open your terminal and run the command ``rspec``

## What Went Well
I found it easy to break the whole process down into a Ruby class with methods. I wanted to improve my API testing framework by creating a method for each test, with all the methods kept apart from the test spec in a separate Ruby file. This is something I have achieved in this homework so I'm pleased! I think Selenium is fun.

## Challenges
I understood that the method

``def first_name_field_displayed
  end``

Was included to check that a first name is being displayed on the web page, however I didn't really know how to implement this. I also struggled to automate the process of uploading a profile picture.

## In a future iteration of this project...
I would like to write more tests and refactor my code. E.g I tried to make one giant accept_dob method containing all three DOB methods. I wanted to be able to run the test with this single method which would trigger the three methods inside it, but it didn't work this time. It would also be interesting to make a class containing a random generator to feed random information into the methods each time the tests are run.
