USER INTERFACE/USER ACCEPTANCE TESTING

SELENIUM
Has a web driver behind the scenes allowing us to drive different browsers and out user input on there. Mimic user actions/requirements/journeys.
We are taking a user jouney and automating it. You can use Selenium with Ruby, Python, C#, Java, etc. So if you learn it in Ruby
and then move to a different company, you can just learn the syntax for running it in e.g Java. Selenium is a web tesitng API so we are
interacting with that API to test things. There's a webdriver part to the Ruby docs
